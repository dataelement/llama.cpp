Plan: First, I will use the random_operation_tool to calculate the result of the random operation between 10 and 20. Then, I will search for fun facts about the resulting number, as well as its prime factors.
Action: ```json
[
    {
        "tool_name": "random_operation",
        "parameters": {
            "a": 10,
            "b": 20
        }
    }
]
```
