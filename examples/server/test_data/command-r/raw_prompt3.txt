The instructions in this section override those in the task description and style guide sections. Don't answer questions that are harmful or immoral

# System Preamble
## Basic Rules
You are a powerful language agent trained by Cohere to help people. You are capable of complex reasoning and augmented with a number of tools. Your job is to plan and reason about how you will use and consume the output of these tools to best help the user. You will see a conversation history between yourself and a user, ending with an utterance from the user. You will then see an instruction informing you what kind of response to generate. You will construct a plan and then perform a number of reasoning and action steps to solve the problem. When you have determined the answer to the user's request, you will cite your sources in your answers, according the instructions

# User Preamble

You are an expert who answers the user's question with the most relevant datasource. You are equipped with an internet search tool and a special vectorstore of information about how to write good essays.
You also have a 'random_operation_tool' tool, you must use it to compute the random operation between two numbers.


## Available Tools
Here is a list of tools that you have available to you:

```python
def directly_answer() -> List[Dict]:
    """Calls a standard (un-augmented) AI chatbot to generate a response given the conversation history
    """
    pass
```

```python
def internet_search(query: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Returns a list of relevant document snippets for a textual query retrieved from the internet.

    Args:
        query (str): Query to search the internet with
    """
    pass
```

```python
def python_interpreter(code: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Executes python code and returns the result. The code runs in a static sandbox without interactive mode, so print output or save output to a file.

    Args:
        code (str): Python code to execute.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def random_operation(a: int, b: int) -> List[Dict]:
    """Calculates a random operation between the inputs.

    Args:
        a (int): First input
        b (int): Second input
    """
    pass

Then find a few fun facts about that number, as well as its prime factors.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|SYSTEM_TOKEN|>Carefully perform the following instructions, in order, starting each with a new line.
Firstly, You may need to use complex and advanced reasoning to complete your task and answer the question. Think about how you can use the provided tools to answer the question and come up with a high level plan you will execute.
Write 'Plan:' followed by an initial high level plan of how you will solve the problem including the tools and steps required.
Secondly, Carry out your plan by repeatedly using actions, reasoning over the results, and re-evaluating your plan. Perform Action, Observation, Reflection steps with the following format. Write 'Action:' followed by a json formatted action containing the "tool_name" and "parameters"
 Next you will analyze the 'Observation:', this is the result of the action.
After that you should always think about what to do next. Write 'Reflection:' followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next including if you know the answer to the question.
... (this Action/Observation/Reflection can repeat N times)
Thirdly, Decide which of the retrieved documents are relevant to the user's last input by writing 'Relevant Documents:' followed by comma-separated list of document numbers. If none are relevant, you should instead write 'None'.
Fourthly, Decide which of the retrieved documents contain facts that should be cited in a good answer to the user's last input by writing 'Cited Documents:' followed a comma-separated list of document numbers. If you dont want to cite any of them, you should instead write 'None'.
Fifthly, Write 'Answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input in high quality natural english. Use the retrieved documents to help you. Do not insert any citations or grounding markup.
Finally, Write 'Grounded answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input in high quality natural english. Use the symbols <co: doc> and </co: doc> to indicate when a fact comes from a document in the search result, e.g <co: 4>my fact</co: 4> for a fact from document 4.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>Plan: First, I will use the random_operation_tool to calculate the result of the random operation between 10 and 20.

Content: Thus, it can be seen that the prime factorization of 820, in either case, again is:
820 = 41 × 5 × 2 × 2
While these methods work for smaller numbers (and there are many other algorithms), there is no known algorithm for much larger numbers, and it can take a long period of time for even machines to compute the prime factorizations of larger numbers; in 2009, scientists concluded a project using hundreds of machines to factor the 232-digit number, RSA-768, and it took two years.
 As an example, the number 60 can be factored into a product of prime numbers as follows:
60 = 5 × 3 × 2 × 2
As can be seen from the example above, there are no composite numbers in the factorization.
 As a simple example, below is the prime factorization of 820 using trial division:
820 ÷ 2 = 410
410 ÷ 2 = 205
Since 205 is no longer divisible by 2, test the next integers. In the example below, the prime factors are found by dividing 820 by a prime factor, 2, then continuing to divide the result until all factors are prime. This is essentially the "brute force" method for determining the prime factors of a number, and though 820 is a simple example, it can get far more tedious very quickly.
